# Air Quality Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **air quality data** using machine learning models.
The workflow includes data cleaning, feature preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## 🛠️ Steps in the Project

1. **Data Loading**

   * Import the dataset `air_quality_for_regression.csv`.

2. **Data Exploration**

   * Initial exploration using `.head()` and `.describe()`.

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Dropping irrelevant columns.
   * Handling missing values and removing outliers.

4. **Feature Engineering**

   * Preparing the dataset for machine learning models.

5. **Model Training**

   * Trained a **baseline model** first.
   * Introduced a **second model** to compare performance and improve accuracy.

6. **Evaluation & Comparison**

   * Evaluated models using appropriate metrics.
   * The **second model** performed better, showing the importance of testing multiple models.

## 📊 Results

* The baseline model gave a starting performance.
* The second model achieved **better evaluation metrics**, proving to be the preferred choice.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* Data preprocessing and cleaning are critical for improving model performance.
* Trying multiple models is essential to identify the best performing approach.
* This project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline from raw data to model evaluation.
